# Azure Architect

- Agility means that you can deploy and configure cloud-based resources quickly as app requirements change.  
- Scalability means that you can add RAM, CPU, or entire virtual machines to a configuration.  
- Elasticity means that you can configure cloud-based apps to take advantage of autoscaling, so apps always have the resources they need.  
- High availability means that cloud-based apps can provide a continuous user experience with no apparent downtime, even when things go wrong.

## Availability Zones

Availability zones are physically separate datacenters within an Azure region.  
Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking.

## Management and Governance Concepts

- Management groups can be used in environments that have multiple subscriptions to streamline the application of governance conditions.  
- Resource groups can be used to organize Azure resources.  
- Administrative units are used to delegate the administration of Microsoft Entra resources, such as users and groups.  
- Accounts are used to provide access to resources.
