## VPN Gateway Scenario
A VPN gateway is a type of virtual network gateway.  
Azure VPN Gateway instances are deployed to a dedicated subnet of a virtual network.  
You can use them to connect on-premises datacenters to virtual networks through a Site-to-Site (S2S) VPN connection.

## Peering
Peering allows you to connect virtual networks together.  
You can link virtual networks together by using virtual network peering.  
Peering enables resources in each virtual network to communicate with each other.

---

## Service Endpoints
Service endpoints are used to expose Azure services to a virtual network, providing communication between the two.

---

## ExpressRoute and Azure VPN Gateway
ExpressRoute is used to connect an on-premises network to Azure.  
ExpressRoute connections and Azure VPN Gateway are two services that you can use to connect an on-premises network to Azure.

### Azure Container Instances (ACI)
Azure Container Instances (ACI) is the fastest and simplest way to run containers in Azure.  
It allows you to run containers without managing virtual machines.  
ACI is suitable for isolated scenarios such as simple applications, task automation, and build jobs.

---

### Azure Functions (FaaS)
Azure Functions is a Function as a Service (FaaS) offering that runs in a serverless architecture.  
Functions are event-driven code blocks triggered by events (triggers).  
Similar serverless solutions are offered by other cloud providers under different names.
