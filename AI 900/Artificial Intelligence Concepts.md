# Computer Vision

- **Image classification**  
  Training a machine learning model to classify images based on their contents.  
  Example: Classifying vehicles in traffic images (taxis, buses, cyclists).

- **Object detection**  
  Models classify individual objects within an image and identify their location using bounding boxes.  
  Example: Detecting and locating vehicles in traffic monitoring solutions.

- **Semantic segmentation**  
  An advanced technique that classifies individual pixels based on the object they belong to.  
  Example: Overlaying images with color masks to highlight different vehicles.

- **Image Analysis**  
  Combines machine learning and image analysis to extract information such as tags and descriptive captions.

- **Face detection**  
  Locates human faces in images and can be combined with classification and facial geometry analysis.

- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**  
  Detects and reads text in images, such as road signs, storefronts, or scanned documents (letters, invoices, forms).

- **Azure Vision Studio**
  - **Image Analysis**: Extracts descriptions, tags, objects, and text from images and video.
  - **Face**: Enables face detection and facial recognition solutions.
  - **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts printed or handwritten text from images.

- Computer vision extracts information from images but is not a search and indexing solution.
- Conversational AI is part of NLP and enables chatbot creation.
- Semantic segmentation classifies individual pixels based on represented objects.
- OCR and Spatial Analysis are part of Azure AI Vision.
- OCR enables detection and reading of text in images.
- Fairness evaluates and mitigates bias in models.
- Privacy ensures privacy provisions are included in AI solutions.
- Transparency clarifies purpose, operation, and limitations of AI solutions.
- Accountability ensures AI systems meet defined ethical and legal standards.
- Inclusiveness ensures AI systems empower people positively and accessibly.
