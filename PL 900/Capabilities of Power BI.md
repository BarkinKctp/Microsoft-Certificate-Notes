# Capabilities of Power BI

## Using Power BI to Build Data-Driven Analytics
Microsoft Power BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn unrelated data sources into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Power BI enables you to:
- Connect to data sources
- Clean and model data without affecting the underlying source
- Visualize and discover insights
- Share insights with others

### Power BI Components
- Power BI Desktop  
- Power BI Service (SaaS)  
- Power BI Mobile  

---

## Power BI Elements
- Capacities  
- Workspaces  
- Semantic Models  
- Shared Semantic Models  
- Reports  
- Dashboards  
- Template Apps

## Cleaning and Transforming Data in Power BI Desktop

Power BI Desktop has three main views:

### Report View
- Build and arrange visualizations
- Design how reports appear to users

### Data View
- View data in a tabular format
- Create measures
- Add calculated columns
- Manage relationships

### Model View
- Visual representation of table relationships
- Modify and manage data model relationships

Power BI Desktop includes **Power Query Editor** for shaping and transforming data.

## AI Insights in Power BI
Power BI provides AI-powered insights to identify trends, anomalies, and patterns automatically.

### AI Insight Types
- Insights for reports  
- Insights for individual visuals  
- Insights for dashboard tiles  
- Quick Insights for datasets  
- AI Insights in Power Query (Azure Cognitive Services)

---

## Notifications
Power BI automatically analyzes reports and dashboards and notifies users when insights are detected.

---

## Insights Pane
The Insights pane displays:
- **Anomalies**
- **Trends**
- **KPI Analysis**

### Anomalies
- Significant anomaly  
- Recent anomaly  
- Anomaly summary  

### Trends
- Long trend  
- Steep trend  
- Recent trend  
- Trend reversal  

### KPI Analysis
- Evaluates current value against a defined target

## Visualizations and Their Use Cases
- **Donut chart**: Shows percentage contribution of each category
- **Combo chart**: Displays two different values in one chart
- **Shape map**: Compares regions using color
- **KPI visualization**: Shows progress toward a goal
- **Line chart**: Displays trends over time
- **Pie chart**: Shows relationship of parts to a whole
- **Bar chart**: Compares values across categories
- **Cards**: Displays single or multiple key data points
- **Funnel**: Visualizes stages in a process

---

## Power BI Apps and Samples
- GitHub template app in Power BI Apps marketplace provides repository analytics
- Power BI Developer Samples repository provides examples for embedded analytics

---

## Performance and Deployment
- **Performance Analyzer**: Measures interaction time for visuals
- **Deployment pipelines**: Manage content across development, test, and production

---

## Reports, Dashboards, and Datasets
- A dataset can be shared and reused
- A report:
  - Is tied to a single dataset
  - Can have multiple pages
- A dashboard:
  - Is a single page
  - Is created from report visuals

Sharing rules:
- Sharing a report or dashboard allows interaction only
- Users cannot create new reports from shared content
- Sharing a Power BI App allows view-only access

---

## Mobile and Views
- Phone view is used in Power BI Mobile
- Only reports can have multiple pages
- Dashboards cannot be created in Power BI Desktop or mobile apps

---

## Modeling and Relationships
- Modeling view shows tables and relationships
- Data view shows rows and columns only
- Relationships can be managed from:
  - Data view
  - Model view
- Report and Filters sections cannot create relationships

---

## Creation Capabilities
- Dashboards and workspaces: Power BI Service only
- Measures: Power BI Desktop only
- Reports: Power BI Desktop and Power BI Service

---

## Charts and Data Representation
- Bar charts compare values across categories
- Pie charts show parts of a whole
- Cards display summary values
- Funnels show sequential stages

---

## Template Apps
- Available in Power BI marketplace
- Include prebuilt reports and dashboards
- Must be connected to data after installation
- Creating a new app is different from installing a template app

---

## Relationship Management
- Relationships can be created using:
  - Manage Relationships (Data view)
  - Model view
- Filters section is used only for filtering visuals
